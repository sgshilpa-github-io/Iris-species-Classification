# Iris-species-Classification


The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimetres. Based on the combination of these four features, I have developed a classification model using hierarchical clustering to distinguish the species from each other.
